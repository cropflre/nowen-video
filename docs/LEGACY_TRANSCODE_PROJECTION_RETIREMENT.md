# Legacy Transcode Projection Retirement

`transcode_jobs`, `transcode_attempts` and `transcode_artifacts` are the only
maintained Runtime history model. The old `transcode_tasks` table is no longer
created by Lite or Full migrations and has no write, retry, cancel, progress or
retention code path.

Existing deployments keep the table unchanged for database rollback and audit.
Runtime History may count it when present, but production code treats it as an
optional read-only import source.

## Legacy directory inventory

Terminal legacy rows with an `output_dir` are imported idempotently into a
deterministic historical Job and a `legacy_hls_directory` Artifact. The file is
not removed immediately. The Artifact receives a seven-day rollback deadline
and enters the same durable Cleanup Lease state machine used by all other
Artifact reclamation.

Invalid or out-of-root paths are blocked with evidence and are never removed.
Missing paths become completed audit tombstones.

## Rollback

During the seven-day observation window, and only before cleanup is claimed,
an administrator can choose **保留目录** in Task Center. This changes the
Artifact to `rollback_completed` and removes it from the cleanup work set
without modifying the directory or resurrecting the old Runtime executor.

The action disappears when the persisted deadline expires. The repository
rechecks the same deadline atomically, so a stale browser cannot extend the
window. A claimed or completed cleanup cannot be rolled back because filesystem
work may already have started.

## Cleanup evidence

Successful cleanup no longer deletes `transcode_artifacts`. It clears the live
path fields and records:

- `cleanup_state=completed`
- completion time and disposition
- original path, temporary path and manifest path
- retained byte count and migration source

Runtime History therefore remains auditable while storage summaries count only
files that may still exist.
